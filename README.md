Problem Description:

What is JavaFX?  JavaFX replaces Swing as the standard UI component for Java.  JavaFX uses a common programming paradigm – designer files that are edited by an external tool, splitting the presentation from the other programming logic.

Here’s the link to the tutorial:

http://code.makery.ch/library/javafx-8-tutorial/

This tutorial will use:

*	JavaFX
*	Introduction to FXML, JavaFX designer file.
*	Introduction to MVC programming model (model / view / controller)
*	Introduction to CSS
*	Introduction to events (press button, UI responds)

It’s a long tutorial, a lot of steps to follow.  Follow each step CAREFULLY.  DO NOT SKIP steps (or later parts won’t work correctly).

*	Complete the JavaFX Tutorial (steps 1-6, skip step 7)
*	Deliverable - JavaFX Project with FXMLs, CSSs
*	Post .ZIP to Sakai and post the solution to GitHub.
